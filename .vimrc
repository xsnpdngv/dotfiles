" ----- AUTOCOMMANDS --------------------------------------------------------

" ----- MOUSE ----------------------------------------------------------------

if has('mouse')
    " Set mouse to work in all modes, resulting easy positioning by clicking
    " and easy Visual mode selection. However, by easy Visual mode selection,
    " default terminal mouse behavior is lost. Default terminal mode mouse
    " behavior can be achieved by pressing <Shift> during clicking
    " (selection). Copy-Paste also works for the selection with Ctrl+Shift+C -
    " Ctrl+Shit+V. MacOS: To temporarily bypass Mouse Reporting and interact
    " with the terminal view, press the <Fn> modifier key while clicking or
    " scrolling. There is also a View > Allow Mouse Reporting (âŒ˜R) menu item
    " you can use to bypass Mouse Reporting for longer periods of time, or if
    " the modifier key isn't available.
    set mouse=a   " all modes
    set mousehide " hide  while typing
    set mousemodel=popup " right mouse button pops up a menu, like in Windows
endif

" ----- CLIPBOARD ------------------------------------------------------------

" Use clipboard as the unnamed '+' register, so Yank-Put cross-works between
" different Vim instances and other programs too
"
" This requires +clipboard feature which is not obvious to have, check it by
" `vim --version`. In case of -clipboard another version of Vim might worth
" considering e.g., vim-gnome, vim-athena, vim-gtx
" MacOS: brew install macvim --with-override-system-vim
"     OR brew install vim --with-client-server
"
" Since the clipboard belongs to the windowing system, in case of remote
" sessions it requires X11 forwarding even for pure terminal use (ssh -Y)
" MacOS: MacVim is able to access the clipboard natively w/o X server running
" but for other cases XQuartz should have all Pasteboard options to be enabled
" under its Preferences
"
if has('clipboard')
    set clipboard=unnamed,unnamedplus,autoselect

    " If X11 forwarding is active and the connection is slow, the process of
    " Vim connecting to the clipboard becomes slow too, resulting delayed
    " startup. Excluding the clipboard will solve this, but obviously the
    " assignment of registers to it will brake.
    "set clipboard=exclude:.* " not to try connecting to the X clipboard
